    "Each week you will pick an NFL team to win their game. You cannot duplicate picks throughout the season. There will be two picks each for weeks 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15. In essence, you will have to pick 23/32 NFL teams throughout the season. If your team’s game ends in a tie, that counts as a win as well. Each player gets three strikes; once you reach that limit you are eliminated."

    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "A rudimentary strategy for NFL Survivor would be to play week-by-week, selecting whichever remaining team has the highest win probability for the current week.  This strategy is prone to failure though, as it fails to look ahead to the future.  My model looks ahead of the NFL schedule, identifying the highest quality picks for not just the current week, but the entire season.  Selecting 23 of the 32 NFL teams to win a game throughout the competition is a challenging task, as there are not 23 reliable teams on a week-by-basis.  My model accounts for this challenge of the contest by optimizing a contestant's selection schedule to pick the less reliable teams when they are up against even less capable opponents."

    "## Model Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect world, we could simply choose the team (or 2 teams) with the greatest win probability to win on a week-by-week basis.  But this method is not plausible due to the non-duplicate team constraint.  Strong teams with a high probability to win one week are likely to also have a high probability to win in other weeks.  As the season progresses and the pool of available teams to select dwindles, the chances of the team with the greatest win probability for that week still being available to select decreases.  This model optimizes the compound win probability for all future picks by looking ahead for favorable matchups and identifying comparative advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a given week, the team with the greatest probability to win may be passed over by the model in favor of a team with a lower probability to win if there is a comparative advantage present between the two teams relating to a future week.  The compound win probability of the resulting combination of picks would be greater than the compound win probability when we always choose the team with the greatest win probability at the current week.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Week 1...  \n",
    "Team1 Win Probability = 90%  \n",
    "Team2 Win Probability = 75%  \n",
    "\n",
    "Week 2...  \n",
    "Team1 Win Probability = 85%  \n",
    "Team2 Win Probability = 55%  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Team1 has the greatest win probability in Week1, it is more efficient to pick Team2, as they have a comparative advantage when compared to the Week 2 win probabilities between the two teams.  \n",
    "There is a 49.5% compound probability by selecting Team1 followed by Team2, compared to a 63.75% compound probability by selecting Team2 followed by Team1.\n",
